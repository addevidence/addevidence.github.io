    <p>Set your team up with a streamlined impact measurement and management system.</p>

<p>Measuring the social impact of your company is impossible with messy data and overwhelming questions. What should you be measuring? How do you make use of this data? What numbers should you pay attention to?</p>

<p>Starting with the impact that you want to have, we will review your activities and build a framework for you to measure the good you do, especially for those things that matter but are hard to measure. We will then digitize your measurement framework so that you have a tool that automatically aggregates evidence across your data sources, making it easy for you to manage, visualize, and share your impact.</p>

<p>This is the Marie Condo solution to your data supply chain leaving your team free to focus on social impact.</p>
