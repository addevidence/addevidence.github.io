    <p>Build our expertise into your organization.</p>

<p>Starting with your current organizational structure, we will build the governance and project management infrastructure so that your organization has in-house expertise in behavioural science, experimentation, or impact management.</p>

<p>We will also ensure your team has the skills they need by guiding your staff as they learn new ways to do things and helping management vet potential hires.</p>

<p>Reinforce your partnerships with seamless impact management.</p>

<p>Great work and valuable relationships can come from collaborations between organizations, but having different impact goals complicates things. Messy data or a partner’s concerns about getting the data they need distract from the intervention and strain the partnership.</p>

<p>Starting with a review of each partner’s data, we will make sure that the measurement framework and data management software meet everyone’s reporting, confidentiality, and management requirements.</p>

<p>Partners will be able to access and share data easily and follow clear rules about protection, security, and privacy.</p>
