    <p>Make data-driven, evidence-based decisions with scientific rigour.</p>

<p>Is what we are doing working? Is it effective? Are we having an impact? If we make this change, will the results be better? How can we safeguard against unexpected side effects or accidental harm?</p>

<p>We can get you answers to questions like these.</p>

<p>Starting with what you want to know and what you want to do with that knowledge, we will figure out the right test to inform your questions and decisions. There are a myriad of research designs, data collection instruments, data analysis tools, and data visualizations, including RCTs, quasi-experimental designs, focus groups, surveys, and interviews. Using this full range of options, we’ll select the right combination of tools for the rigour of evidence you need in the time you need it. For any question you have, we can guide you forward, showing you how to answer it or explaining why it can’t be answered with evidence. We can also suggest useful questions if you are not asking them already.</p>

<p>Our tests will give you strategic, data driven, and evidence based decision making that enhances your impact and brings you peace of mind.</p>
