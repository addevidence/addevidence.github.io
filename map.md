Get to the cutting edge with a of the evidence base.

Thoughtfulness is costly and you can save time and resources where this thinking has already been done by pulling from academia, but this is not straightforward. Academia is not a single source of truth. Rather than a Google search answered by well coordinated experts, it is more like a room of interested people standing in circles sharing their ideas. Some circles disagree on the most productive way to think about the problem and form different schools of thought. Other circles focus on the best ways to measure and create evidence. Like most conferences, few people know everyone else and are aware of all the conversations taking place.

Building off of how you think about your work, we will get you familiar with these conversations so you learn what rigour looks like in your field, get specialized tools for the data you want to collect, and discover ways to think about the underlying dynamics of your issue that open up more options to act.

In the long term, you will be able to revisit these conversations with your specific questions and update your approach with new efficiencies developed in the community, saving you time and keeping your work on the cutting edge.

Make a strategic impact with a map of the problem space.

Starting with what you know about the issue, we will help you understand how the problem comes to be so you can more effectively disrupt it.

Your expertise will grow to cover how many people are affected, how much they are affected, and whether different sub-groups are affected differently. You’ll know how people understand the problem as they experience it and how they talk about it. You’ll see how specific your target population needs to be, what structures or external groups need to be acted on, and who is already active in the space. You will get confidence that you are solving the right problem.

Identify quick wins with a map of your data coverage.

Starting from the impact you want to have, we will review your data sources and map how your data links to that impact.

You will learn what decision areas are currently well supported, what areas are missing data, and what data is available but not being used.

With this map you will know your gaps and get the most from your data.
